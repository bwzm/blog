title: '2022 Book List'
pubDate: 'Jun 1 2021'

I've been inspired by various others on my Twitter feed to make something of a proposed book list
for myself in 2022. I historically do not follow these sorts of lists very well at all, and in fact
this list says far more about what I'm thinking about right now, than it does about what I will
actually read this year, but perhaps in doing it I'll give myself a little motivation. I'm sure I
won't read everything on this list, and I'm sure I'll read many things that _aren't_ on this list,
but everyone must start somewhere.

**Modern theology:**

-   Karl Barth, _Evangelical Theology_
-   Karl Barth, _Dogmatics in Outline_
-   D.B. Hart, _The Experience of God_
-   N.T. Wright _The New Testament and the People of God_
-   N.T. Wright, _Jesus and the Victory of God_
-   Thomas Hopko _The Orthodox Faith_ (4 vols.)
-   Jake Meador, _In Search of the Common Good_
-   Hans Boersma, _Heavenly Participation_

**Ancient Theology:**

-   Augustine, _The City of God_

    -   I've read this through at least three times now, but I feel like I need to read it again,
        expecially the last half, because modern right-wing ideologues are really confused about the
        difference between the city of man and the city of God and I need to remind myself of
        sanity.

-   Gregory of Nyssa, _The Great Catechism_
-   Gregory of Nyssa, _On the Soul and the Resurrection_
-   Gregory of Nyssa, _Against Eumenius_ (if I really feel like it)
-   Origen, _De Principiis_
-   Gregory Palamas, _The Triads_
-   The Cloud of Unknowing

**History**:

-   Jaroslav Pelikan, _The Christian Tradition: A History of the Development of Doctrine_ (5 vols.)
-   Robert Wilken, _The First Thousand Years: A Global History of Christianity_
-   D.G. Hart, _The Lost Soul of American Protestantism_
-   Diarmaid MacCulloch, _The Reformation: A History_

**Philosophy/Other:**

-   John Henry Newman, _Apologia Pro Via Sua_
    -   I've read this before, but it's been a while, and I feel I'd get more out of it by reading
        it again
-   Carl Trueman, _The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self_
-   Wittgenstein, _On Certainty_
-   Kierkegaard, Various Selections
    -   I like Kierkegaard, but I don't know what specifically of him I want to read this year, and
        I'm certainly not going to read through the entirety of his selected works that I have on my
        shelf.

**Fiction:**

-   Whatever my wife and brother-in-law makes me read. Heh.
