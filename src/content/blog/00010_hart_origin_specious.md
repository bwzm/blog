> reduce a story to its most elementary logic -- all of which is very admirable where matters of
> plain fact are at issue. But when one begins to touch upon matters of a more abstract frame or of
> a more cosmic scope -- say, God, the history of religion, the nature of morality, social
> evolution, historical determinism, ultimate purpose, and so on -- then it is often the case that
> the only valuable answers will prove no less complex and daunting than the questions that have
> prompted them. At that point the journalist's otherwise commendable passion to establish "the real
> story" becomes more a hindrance than an aid to understanding.
